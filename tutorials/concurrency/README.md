# ‚ÅâÔ∏èWhat is concurrency?
- Concurrency is the capability of having more than one computation in progress at the same time.
- Concurrency is a different type of programming. So not only: procedural, functional and OOP. 
- Concurrency is what allows: concurrent, parallel and asynchronous execution.

## üì¶Packages
- Native:
  - Python **multiprocessing** for process-based concurrency. A process refers to a computer program. Multiprocesses are appropriate for CPU-bound tasks, and not I/O-bound tasks.
  - Python **threading** for thread-based concurrency. A thread refers to a thread of execution by a computer program. Because of the GIL, threads are appropriate for I/O-bound tasks, and not CPU-bound tasks.
  - Python **asyncio** for coroutine-based concurrency. A coroutine is a unit of concurrency that is more lightweight than a thread.
- Third parties:
    - ray: a framework for scaling Python applications.
    - tornado: Python web framework and asynchronous networking library.
    - celery: Distributed task queue.
    - sanic: Async Python web server and framework.
    - aiohttp: Asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio
    - dask: Parallel computing with task scheduling.
    - uvloop: Ultra fast asyncio event loop.
